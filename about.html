                        <p>
                            I am a final year student at Daffodil International University studying Computer Science and Technology (CSE). As I am passionate about computer technology, every day I try to learn about new technology and staying up to date with the current tech world. New software and apps fascinate me with the innovative way of problem solution.
                            As I am interested in software and website development, I from Sirajganj. I grow up there. I complete my Diploma from Ahsanullah Institute of Technical and Vocational and Education and Training (AITVET).
                            I aspire to open my own IT farm in 15 years. The farm will be a place for passionate people like me to pursue my goal to present the world with something new and useful.
                            For leisure period, I mostly learn new programming languages and read articles about new software technology. I enjoy playing online games and occasionally siting with my guitar and relax for the moment.
